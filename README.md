## Autonomous Forklift Robot

This project was developed as part of the Electrical Systems Design course at BCIT. It features a fully autonomous forklift robot capable of identifying packages using ArUco markers and transporting them from an unsorted truck to the appropriate sorted location.

### Features:
- **C++ software** running on a **Raspberry Pi 4**
- **OpenCV + ArUco marker detection** for package identification
- **TCP/IP communication** between control modules
- **3D printed chassis and fork**, designed in **SolidWorks**
- **Custom PCB** for motor and sensor interfacing, built with **KiCad**
- **2 stepper motors** for drivetrain movement
- **4 servo motors** for lifting and package handling
- Onboard supervisor: **Tigger** 🐯

All STL files and C++ source code are included in this repository.
